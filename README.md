Performance Meter for Corona SDK development


Readings are in order - FPS, Texture Memory in MB, Lua Memory in kB

Tapping on the meter will trigger garbage collector - handy functionality to test memory leaks.
It also stops readings to change - if it's hard for you to read rapidly changing text.
So if you want just to trigger the garbage collector - use double tap (or double click in the sim).
